Project Pitch: Average Time Spending on Social Media

Objective:  
This project aims to explore and analyze the average time individuals spend on social media platforms and the factors influencing this behavior. 

Problem Statement:
Social media usage has become an integral part of modern life, but the growing trend of excessive screen time raises concerns about its impact on users' lives. Despite the widespread usage of platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, there is little awareness about how much time people truly spend on social media, how it varies across age groups, or its long-term effects.

Goals:
1.	Quantify Time Spent: Analytics to determine the average time people spend on social media per day.
2.	Segment by Demographics: Break down the data by age, gender, location, and occupation to identify patterns in usage.
3.	Analyze Behavior: Investigate the factors that contribute to social media usage, such as income, debt, and homeownership.
   
Analysis: Utilize statistical methods to analyze time patterns, correlate them with mood/behavioral changes, and create a comprehensive report.

Expected Outcome:
•	Average Time spent on Social Media by Gender (male vs female)
•	Average Time spent on Social Media by Age Group and Gender (Under 20 male vs female, age 20 and 40 male vs female, over 40 male vs female)
•	Average Time spent by interest group (Sports, Travel, Lifestyle)
•	Most Used Application by Gender (male vs female)
•	Time spent by Occupation (Students vs Professionals)
•	Total Time Spent by Gender and demographics (male vs female in urban)
•	Time spent by home owners vs. not home owners

Significance:
As digital consumption continues to rise, this project will provide crucial data for individuals, educators, and policymakers to address the social and psychological impact of prolonged social media use. It can also lead to better time management practices, enhancing users' personal and professional lives while maintaining a balanced relationship with digital platforms.

Why It Matters:
In a world where social media can be both a source of connection and distraction, it’s essential to foster awareness around its usage. This project will empower individuals to reclaim control of their time, make informed decisions, and promote a healthier digital culture for the future.
